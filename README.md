# Customer-Churn-Prediction-for-Telecommunication-Company
• Developed and implemented a machine learning model to predict customer churn in the 
telecommunication industry, utilizing Python and Power BI for data analysis and visualization.
• Performed data preprocessing and feature engineering on customer datasets, handling missing values, 
outlier detection, and transforming categorical variables for model training.
• Built and evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random
Forests) with performance metrics such as accuracy (85%), precision, and AUC-ROC (0.90).
• Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key customer metrics, enabling stakeholders to 
track churn patterns and devise targeted retention strategies.
